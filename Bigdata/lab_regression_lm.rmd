This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(MASS)
library(plyr)
```

### Interaction terms in regression

```{r}
# Building up the familiar birthwt data...

# Rename the columns to have more descriptive names
colnames(birthwt) <- c("birthwt.below.2500", "mother.age", "mother.weight", 
    "race", "mother.smokes", "previous.prem.labor", "hypertension", "uterine.irr", 
    "physician.visits", "birthwt.grams")

# Transform variables to factors with descriptive levels
birthwt <- transform(birthwt, 
            race = as.factor(mapvalues(race, c(1, 2, 3), 
                              c("white","black", "other"))),
            mother.smokes = as.factor(mapvalues(mother.smokes, 
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes"))),
            hypertension = as.factor(mapvalues(hypertension, 
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes"))),
            uterine.irr = as.factor(mapvalues(uterine.irr, 
                              c(0,1), c("no", "yes")))
            )
```

**(a)** Run a linear regression to better understand how birthweight varies with the mother's age and smoking status (do not include interaction terms).

```{r}
# Run regression model
birthwt.lm <- lm(birthwt.grams ~ mother.age + mother.smokes, data = birthwt)

# Output coefficients table
summary(birthwt.lm)

```

**(b)** What is the coefficient of mother.age in your regression?  How do you interpret this coefficient?

```{r}
coef(birthwt.lm)["mother.age"]

age.coef <- round(coef(birthwt.lm)["mother.age"], 1)
```

**Note: This solution uses inline code chunks.** The coefficient is `r age.coef`.  This means that among mothers with the same smoking status, each additional year of age is on average associated with a `r age.coef`g increase in birthweight. 

**(c)** How many coefficients are estimated for the mother's smoking status variable?  How do you interpret these coefficients?

```{r}
coef(birthwt.lm)["mother.smokesyes"]

smoke.coef <- abs(round(coef(birthwt.lm)["mother.smokesyes"], 1))
```

**Note: This solution uses inline code chunks.**  There is just one coefficient estimated.  This coefficient gives us the average difference in birthweight between mothers that smoke and mother's that don't, in a model that adjusts for the effect of mother's age.  That is, after we adjust for the effect of age, smoking leads to an average `r smoke.coef` decrease in birthweight.  

**(d)** Using ggplot, construct a scatterplot with birthweight on the y-axis and mother's age on the x-axis.  Color the points by mother's smoking status, and add smoking status-specific linear regression lines using the `stat_smooth` layer.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

# Note fullrange = TRUE is used here to extend the 'mother.smokes = yes' line beyond the maximum age (35) in this group
qplot(data = birthwt, x = mother.age, y = birthwt.grams, colour = mother.smokes) + stat_smooth(method = "lm", fullrange = TRUE)
```

```{r}
birthwt.lm$model
```

```{r}

formula_birthwt <- lm(birthwt.grams ~ mother.smokes + mother.weight + race, data=birthwt)
summary(formula_birthwt)

```

```{r}
View(birthwt)
```

```{r}
pd <- predict(birthwt.lm, birthwt[2,], level = 0.99)
str(pd)
pd

pd <- predict(birthwt.lm, birthwt[3,], level = 0.99)
str(pd)
pd
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
